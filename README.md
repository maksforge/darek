# Darek

Darek is a Polish voice assistant for Android. Say *"Darek, otwórz bramę"* and he answers you out
loud and calls your gate's GSM opener, so the gate opens without touching the phone.

Everything happens on the phone: speech recognition and the spoken replies run offline, and the app
never opens a network connection. Free, no ads, no account.

## Status

Just bootstrapped from [android-starter](https://github.com/maksforge/android-starter). The release
pipeline and quality gates are real; the screens are still the template's placeholder app. Nothing
is on Play yet.

## Contributing

Darek is source-available, not open source: read it, verify it, file issues. Pull requests are not
accepted — see [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Build

./gradlew assembleDebug          # build

./gradlew spotlessApply          # format (the CI gate is spotlessCheck)
python3 scripts/project.py       # what the toolchain thinks this app is called
```
