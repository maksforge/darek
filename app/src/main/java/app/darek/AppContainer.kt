/**
 * Manual dependency injection — deliberately not Hilt.
 *
 * At the size a single-developer app reaches, constructing things by hand is clearer than a
 * generated graph: the whole object graph is this file, you can read it top to bottom, and there is
 * no annotation processor round trip in every build. Migrating to Hilt later is mechanical, because
 * everything here is already constructor injection.
 *
 * The rule that makes it work: **nothing constructs its own dependencies.** A ViewModel takes what it
 * needs through its constructor, and only this file calls a constructor.
 * The moment a class reaches for a singleton instead, it stops being testable without a device.
 *
 * Lives at the package root with the app shell: like `Navigation.kt`, it describes how the app hangs
 * together rather than belonging to any one screen.
